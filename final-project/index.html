    <p>The lovely mini pitbull is named Shadow! He is not the father of the two puppies, but is the foundation of their adoption. Shadow has unfortunatle passed away. He has been dearly missed this last year, but he lived an amazing 13 years of life. He was father to 2 litters too! Shadow was bigger than life for being so small and he lived it with love and gentleness! He was an amazing companion!</p>
