    <h3>Shepksy Information</h3>
    <p>German shepherd Husky mix, also known as Gerberian Shepsky, is a mixed breed of Siberian Husky and German Shepherd. 
        Both these dog breeds have their specific characteristics, for which most passionate dog lovers prefer them. 
        German Shepherds are loyal and gentle family dogs with the most intimidating characters, just like their size. 
        While Huskies are admired for their beauty and attractiveness, the fact that they can be sometimes difficult to handle because of their energy and demeanor makes them difficult to handle.
        This breed weighs about 45-48 pounds in weight.
        It can live a maximum of up to 10-14 years.
        These dogs are physically very attractive, just like both their parents are
        Temperament
        These dogs are adaptable to any hot and cold environment; however, they are not fit for apartment living because of their character traits and size.
        This hybrid breed is extremely intelligent, just like both its parents, and is easy to train.
        Gerberian Shepsky is highly energetic and thus requires time to exercise daily.
        They are playful.
        They require quality time with their owners.
        Their quality training is a must to avoid their behavioral deviances.
        These dogs are extremely loyal, affectionate, and protective towards their owners. 
        It is good for the owners to take some time to groom them once or twice a week to enhance their physical attractiveness and strengthen their bond with their dogs. </p>
